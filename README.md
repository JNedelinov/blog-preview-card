## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I'd love to be more confident whenever I have to size different components. For example, I know that having a concrete size of an element with pixels is not of the best practices, and currently I have blockers here and I spend a lot of time thinking of solutions.
